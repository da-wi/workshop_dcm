# DCM Workshop

This practical workshop was held in fall semester 2021 at the University of Zurich. 
It provides a hands on introdcution to effective connectivity analysis with dynamic causal modeling within the parametric empirical Bayes framework for fMRI data.


Two papers that give a practical overview in DCM and I found very helpful in the beginning (i.e. very little Math!) :

* Stephan et al., (2010), "Ten simple rules for dynamic causal modeling", https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909011999 (note that the description of group-level analysis is "the old way" to do it, and not what we will cover in this workshop)

* Zeidmann et al., (2019) "A guide to group effective connectivity analysis, part 1: First level analysis with DCM for fMRI", https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919305221 (a good read and more towards the modern DCM PEB framework)
